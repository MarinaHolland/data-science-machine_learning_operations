## Machine Learning Operations

## Overview 📝
This repository contains a notebook focused on how to use MLFlow in a Machine Learning proyect. 

## Objective 🎯
The objective is to learn how to log, register and deploy different models. We will be working with a Kaggle Challenge dataset centered in loan predictions.

## Methodology 🔍
1. Data collection & Preprocessing 📊: using a Kaggle dataset with variables that will help to predict whether a customer will be approved for a loan based on features such as income or age.
2. Model Selection & Training 🧠: we will explore different models for a classification model and we will compare and contrast them.
3. Model Evaluation 📈:be chosen based on these metrics. 
4. Tracking with MLFlow 📋: MLFlow will be used to log experiments, model parameters and metrics and the best one will be registered.
5. Model Deployment 🚀: the best model will be exported and deployed and this will allow us to make requests to the model and get the predictions directly from MLFlow.
6. Docker for Model Deployment 🐳: docker was used to containerize the model, which allows us to make sure that the model can run consistently across different environments.

This methodology ensures the model is effective, scalable, and manageable throughout its lifecycle. Using MLFlow provides full control over the development process, from experimentation to deployment and monitoring.
